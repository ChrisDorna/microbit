# Getting started

## Step 1

Welkom! Place the ``||basic:show string||`` block in the ``||basic:on start||`` slot. Replace the ``"Hello"`` text with your name. Did you see it scroll?

```blocks
basic.showString("Micro!")
```

## Step 2

Connect a USB cable to the @boardname@ and click ``|Download|``. Save the program to the **@drivename@** drive. This transfers your code to the @boardname@!

## Step 3

Well, the text stopped. Place the ``||basic:show string||`` block in the ``||input:on button pressed||`` slot to scroll your name when button **A** is pressed.
